  - Rename `CollectibleDetectionController` to `NftDetectionController`, and rename all methods, controller properties, types, constants, and state properties to use the term "NFT" instead of "collectible".
  - Rename `AssetsContractController` method `getERC721CollectibleTokenId` to `getERC721NftTokenId`.
  - Rename `assetsUtil` method `compareCollectiblesMetadata` to `compareNftMetadata`.
  - Rename constant `ASSET_TYPES.COLLECTIBLE` to `ASSET_TYPES.NFT`
  - Rename `PreferencesController` state property `useCollectibleDetection` to `useNftDetection`
  - Rename `PreferenceController` method `setUseCollectibleDetection` to `setUseNftDetection`

### Fixed
- Fix NetworkController `lookupNetwork` deadlock ([#948](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/948))
- Fix invalid `rpcTarget` and `nickname` network state after switching from custom network to Infura network using `setProviderType` ([#947](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/947))

## [32.0.2]
### Fixed
- Fix issue introduced in v32.0.1 where EthQuery is not instantiated correctly on GasFeeController when constructed ([#936](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/936))

## [32.0.1]
### Fixed
- Make both callback and messaging system options for `TokenListController` & `GasFeeController` when listening to `NetworkController` ([#932](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/932))
- Add error handling when eth_estimateGas fails in TransactionController ([#920](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/920))

## [32.0.0]
### Added
- Add `isOutOfDate` to the PhishingController, for checking whether the phishing lists are out-of-date. ([#929](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/929))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Make the PhishingController `test` synchronous ([#929](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/929))
  - Rather than being polled regularly (as it was pre-v31), or updated on fetch (as in v31), the phishing lists are no longer updated automatically at all. You will need to manually call `isOutOfDate` to check whether they are out-of-date, and then call `updatePhishingLists` to update them.
- **BREAKING**: Migrate NetworkController to BaseControllerV2 ([#903](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/903))
  - There is no more "controller configuration" with BaseControllerV2. Instead configuration is set by constructor parameters.
  - The constructor accepts a single "options" object rather than separate parameters. The initial state is now passed as part of this options object, via the `state` property.
  - The constructor must be passed the `infuraProjectId` and `messenger` options. The messenger should be a restricted controller messenger.
  - Controller subscriptions must be registered through the controller messenger, rather than through the controller directly.
  - A `providerChange` event has been added. This is dispatched when the provider instance variable is updated.
    - When there is a network switch, this is dispatched after the network has been fully initialized.
  - A new `getEthQuery` action has been added, for obtaining an `EthQuery` instance that is already setup with the current provider
    - Note that it will stop working when the provider changes, so you should call this again each time the `providerChange` event is dispatched.

### Fixed
- Prevent parallel phishing configuration updates ([#930](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/930))
- Fix issues with empty responses in ERC20Standard ([#927](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/927))
  - Calling `getTokenSymbol` and `getTokenDecimals` on contracts that return empty values (`0x`) for `symbol()` and `decimals()` will now throw an error.

## [31.2.0]
### Changed
- Update phishing configuration update URL to reduce cache delay ([#915](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/915))
- Update `@keystonehq/metamask-airgapped-keyring` from `^0.3.0` to `^0.6.1` ([#913](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/913))

### Fixed
- Allow Optimism & Optimism Testnet to be added via `wallet_addEthereumChain` ([#910](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/910))
- Fix regression where a phishing configuration update network failure would cause the `test` method to fail ([#915](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/915))
- Prevent duplicate phishing configuration update network requests ([#915](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/915))

## [31.1.0]
### Added
- Add new error type - `ApprovalRequestNotFoundError` ([#909](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/909))

### Changed
- Replace `ethers` with submodules (`@ethersproject/**`) ([#907](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/907))

## [31.0.0]
### Added
- Add support for caveats on endowment permissions ([#878](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/878))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Bump to Node 14 ([#893](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/893))
- **BREAKING:** PhishingController is now async ([#897](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/897))
  - `PhishingController.test` now returns a Promise
  - `PhishingController.setRefreshInterval` should now be used to change the polling interval
- Changed TokenController._createEthersContract to no longer be async ([#895](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/895))

## [30.3.0]
### Added
- Add new functionality to the CollectiblesController to verify the transaction state of a collectible ([#762](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/762)).
  - Add new method to the CollectiblesController to search a Collectible by smart contract address and token ID (`findCollectibleByAddressAndTokenId`).
  - Add new method to the CollectiblesController to update the state of a Collectible (`updateCollectible`).
  - Add new method to the CollectiblesController to reset the transaction status of a Collectible (`resetCollectibleTransactionStatusByTransactionId`).
- Add new method `validatePassword` to KeyringController to validate the password ([#884](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/884))
- Add `formatIconUrlWithProxy` function for formatting iconUrl Proxy for tokens from Swaps API ([#889](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/889))

## [30.2.0]
### Changed
- Updated the Testnet Ticker string format to be prefixed with the network name (e.g. <network name>ETH) ([#868](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/868))

## [30.1.0]
### Added
- Allow clients to avoid third party tokenlist polling ([#861](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/861)):
  - Added a new configuration property `preventPollingOnNetworkRestart` is added to TokenListController.
  - Added a method to update the new preventPollingOnNetworkRestart property value.
  - Added a method to reset the `tokenList` and `tokensChainsCache` properties in state. 

## [30.0.2]
### Added
- Adds method `isTokenListSupportedForNetwork` which returns `SupportedTokenDetectionNetworks` plus the local ganache network chainId. Then changes TokenListController to use this method to check whether or not to start polling, so that polling can occur on ganache networks to allow for e2e testing ([#855](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/855))

## [30.0.1]
### Fixed
- Change `formatIconUrlWithProxy` to accept hex strings for `chainId` ([#851](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/851))
 - This change fixes an issue introduced in v30.0.0 for metamask-extension where the `chainId` is currently represented as a hexadecimal in the TokensController and was, as a result, getting invalid URL responses from `formatIconUrlWithProxy` which previously expected its `chainId` argument to be in decimal format.

## [30.0.0]
### Added
- **BREAKING:** Introduce `getNetworkState`, `getPreferencesState`, and `onTokenListStateChange` to the TokenDetectionController constructor options object ([#808](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/808))
  - `getPreferencesState` provides the default value for `useTokenDetection` from the PreferencesController state.
  - `getNetworkState` provides the default value for `chainId` from the NetworkController state.
  - `onTokenListStateChange` listener triggers a detect action whenever the TokenListController finishes fetching a token list.
- **BREAKING:** Update AssetsContractController to keep track of the current network (accessible via config.chainId) as well as whether the network supports token detection ([#809](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/809))
  - Consumers will need to pass listener method `onNetworkStateChange` in AssetsContractController constructor options object. This method should be called with network/provider details when network changes occur.
- Add `onCollectibleAdded` event handler to the CollectiblesController constructor ([#814](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/814))
  - This event handler was added to allow us to capture metrics.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Rename `addTokens` on the TokenDetectionController constructor options object to `addDetectedTokens` ([#808](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/808))
  - We are no longer automatically adding detected tokens to the wallet. This will provide users with the ability to manually import or ignore detected tokens.
- **BREAKING:** Rename `useStaticTokenList` to `useTokenDetection` on the PreferencesController constructor options object and set the value to be true by default ([#808](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/808))
  - Token detection will now be enabled by default.
- **BREAKING:** Append phishfort blocklist to list used by PhishingController ([#715](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/715))
  - The `test` method on `PhishingController` no longer returns a boolean, it now returns an object matching the `EthPhishingDetectResult` interface (defined in `PhishingController.ts`).
  - Designs may need to be updated to account for the fact that sites may now be blocked by Phishfort. We should ensure users are not directed to the `eth-phishing-detect` repository to dispute Phishfort blocks, because we will not be able to help them.
- **BREAKING:** Rename `convertPriceToDecimal` function name to `convertHexToDecimal` ([#808](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/808))
- Rename `fetchFromDynamicTokenList` to `fetchTokenList` ([#806](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/806))
  - No need to mention dynamic in the naming since there is only one way to fetch the token list.
- Update `fetchFromCache` in TokenListController to return `TokenListMap | null` instead of `TokenListToken[] | null` ([#806](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/806))
  - This allows us to remove some unnecessary mapping when working with cached tokens and token list.
- Update `TokenListToken` in TokenListController to include `aggregators` property ([#806](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/806))
  - This allows us to show the aggregator names for a token.
- Update TokensController to support detected tokens ([#808](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/808))
  - Introduce `detectedTokens` to the config object to track detected tokens, which is updated by calling `addDetectedTokens` whenever TokenDetectionController detects new tokens.
  - Added `fetchTokenMetadata` private method to fetch token metadata whenever adding individual tokens. This is currently used to populate aggregator information.
- Append `detectedTokens` to both TokenBalancesController & TokenRatesController `tokens` config object within their `onTokensStateChange` listener methods ([#808](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/808))
  - This change ensures that we are populating both balances and rates for detected tokens.
- Update CollectibleDetectionController to place a proxy API (provided by Codefi) in front of OpenSea requests ([#805](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/805))
  - All NFT related queries that were routed to OpenSea will now first route to a proxy server owened by Codefi. If this first request fails, and an OpenSea API key has been set, the query will re-route to OpenSea as a fallback.
- Update CurrencyRateController to use ETH exchange rate for preloaded testnets native currency (Rinkeby, Ropsten, Goerli, Kovan) ([#816](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/816))
- Update ERC721Standard to query for name and symbol values on ERC721 contracts even when the contract does not support the metadata interface ([#834](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/834))
- Increase polling interval for TokenListController and require minimum of 3 occurrences across our aggregated public token lists for use in the dynamic token list ([#836](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/836))

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove `removeAndIgnoreToken` from TokensController ([#808](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/808))
  - The logic for removing token(s) is now consolidated in a new method named `ignoredTokens`. Consumers will need to update instances of `removeAndIgnoreToken` to use `ignoredTokens` instead.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `onTokensStateChange` from the TokenDetectionController constructor options object ([#808](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/808))
  - This was previously used to update the `tokens` property in the controller's configuration object. This is not needed since those tokens are managed by the TokensController.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `useStaticTokenList` and `onPreferencesStateChange` from TokenListController constructor options object ([#806](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/806))
  - `useStaticTokenList` was previously used to determined if this controller fetched against a static vs dynamic token list and `onPreferencesStateChange` was used to update `useStaticTokenList`.
  - The controller now always fetches from a dynamic token list.
- **BREAKING:** Remove snap-specific network-access endowment ([#820](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/820))
  - Consumers who still require this endowment should import from `@metamask/snap-controllers` minimum version 0.13.0.

### Fixed
- Update AssetsContractController to fix issues parsing non-standard ERC-20 responses ([#830](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/830))
 - Now correctly reads token contract values for decimals and symbol with solidity return type `bytes32`.

## [29.0.1]
### Added
- Add SupportedTokenDetectionNetworks enum and util for token detection support. ([#811](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/811))

### Fixed
- Fix bug introduced in v29.0.0 where `createNewVaultAndRestore` would crash with a validation failure. ([#819](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/819))


## [29.0.0]
### Added
- Reintroduce NotificationController for in-app notifications ([#709](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/709))
- Add optional token service timeout parameter([#793](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/793))

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Bump eth-keyring-controller to 7.0.1 ([#802](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/802))
  - Mnemonics in keyrings of type `HD Key Tree` are always serialized as arrays of numbers. `exportSeedPhrase` now returns a buffer rather than a string, consumers will need to adapt to this new return type accordingly.

## [28.0.0]
### Added
- Add GrantPermissions action to PermissionsController ([#780](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/780))
- Add `PermissionController.revokePermissionForAllSubjects` action ([#764](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/764))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Rename NotificationController to AnnouncementController ([#697](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/697))
  - The `NotificationController` class is now `AnnouncementController`.
  - The controller `notifications` state has been renamed to `announcements`.
  - All other exported types including the word "notification" have been updated to use the word "announcement" instead.

## [27.1.1]
### Fixed
- Move `@keystonehq/metamask-airgapped-keyring` to dependencies ([#757](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/757))

## [27.1.0] [DEPRECATED]
### Added
- Now the `KeyringController` supports the `QRKeyring` from `@keystonehq/metamask-airgapped-keyring`. Developers can enable the import of accounts from a QR hardware wallet. A new optional parameter, `setAccountLabel` from the `PreferencesController`, should be passed to the `KeyringController` to enable this new functionality. ([#685](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/685))
  - **UPDATE:** This is broken. Consumers are encouraged to upgrade to [27.1.1].

### Changed
- Bump `eth-phishing-detect` version from 1.1.14 to 1.1.16 ([#742](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/742))
- Bump `@metamask/contract-metadata` from 1.31.0 to 1.33.0 ([#730](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/730))

### Fixed
- Improve error message when attempting to import an invalid private key ([#739](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/739))

## [27.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Further reduce load on Infura by removing non-critical data from the fallback implementation of the Gas API ([#712](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/712))
  - In GasFeeEstimates – the type of the object returned by `fetchGasEstimatesViaEthFeeHistory` as well as type of `gasFeeEstimates` stored in GasFeeController — `historicalBaseFeeRange`, `baseFeeTrend`, `latestPriorityFeeRange`, `historicalPriorityFeeRange`, `priorityFeeTrend`, and `networkCongestion` can now be null. You should update your code to account for this.
  - The ExistingFeeHistoryBlock and NextFeeHistoryBlock types were inconvenient to use and are no longer public. You should use FeeHistoryBlock instead.
  - The BlockFeeHistoryDatasetFetcher class has been removed. There is no replacement.
  - The `calculateBaseFeeRange`, `calculateBaseFeeTrend`, `calculateNetworkCongestion`, `calculatePriorityFeeRange`, and `calculatePriorityFeeTrend` functions have been removed. There are no replacements.
- Update AssetsContractController to make `userAddress` of `getTokenStandardAndDetails` optional ([#717](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/717))

### Fixed
- Fix RateLimitController so that the rate limit is not reset aggressively ([#716](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/716))

## [26.0.0]
### Added
- Add PermissionController and SubjectMetadataController ([#692](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/692))
- Add RateLimitController ([#698](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/698))
- Add `revokePermissions` to PermissionController actions ([#708](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/708))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Fetch and return token image as part of `getDetails` calls on ERC721Standard and ERC1155Standard ([#702](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/702))
  - This change is breaking because it requires that the AssetsContractController (on which the ERC721Standard and ERC1155Standard are instantiated) be passed a listener for onPreferencesStateChange from the PreferencesController so that it can use the user's preferred IPFSGateway to fetch any images hosted on IPFS. Consumers will have to pass onPreferencesStateChange in an options object (first arg) to the AssetsContractController constructor when initializing.
- Reduce load on Infura in gas estimate API fallback ([#705](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/705))
- Update `fetchBlockFeeHistory` to account for nonexistent `baseFeePerGas` ([#703](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/703))
- Update `fetchBlockFeeHistory` to account for test chains with a few number of blocks ([#699](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/699))
- Expose `WebSocket` via endowments for network access ([#696](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/696))
- Bump `@metamask/metamask-eth-abis` from ^2.1.0 to 3.0.0 ([#681](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/681))

## [25.1.0]
### Changed
- Make the userAddress argument to the getDetails method on the ERC20Standard class optional. ([#674](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/674))

## [25.0.0]
### Added
- Add optional third argument to method `checkAndUpdateSingleCollectibleOwnershipStatus` on CollectiblesController, which contains the userAddress and chainId to check asset ownership against. If not included, the method will still check against the currently configured selectedAddress and chainId configured in the CollectiblesController ([#672](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/672))
- Add `getTokenStandardAndDetails` method on AssetsContractController which determines whether the input contract conforms to particular known token standard (`ERC20`, `ERC721` or `ERC1155`) and returns the detected standard along with some key values/details about that the contract and/or specified token within that contract ([#667](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/667))

### Changed
- - **BREAKING** - Standardize ERC721/1155/20 method names ([#667](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/667))
  - Renames many methods on the AssetsContractController to include the contract type they are used by in the name in a standardized structure (i.e. `getAssetName` -> `getERC721AssetName` and `balanceOfERC1155Collectible` ->  `getERC1155BalanceOf`).
  - Consumers will need to look at the AssetsContractController for any methods they consume and adapt names accordingly. 

## [24.0.0]
### Added
- Add `checkAndUpdateSingleCollectibleOwnershipStatus` method ([#669](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/669))

### Changed
- - **BREAKING**:  Rename `checkAndUpdateCollectibleOwnershipStatus` to `checkAndUpdateAllCollectibleOwnershipStatus`  ([#669](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/669))
  - Previously incorrectly released as minor version bump 23.1.0.
  - Consumers who used `checkAndUpdateCollectibleOwnershipStatus` must update it's name to `checkAndUpdateAllCollectibleOwnershipStatus`.

## [23.1.0] [DEPRECATED]
### Added
- Add checkAndUpdateSingleCollectibleOwnershipStatus method ([#669](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/669))

## [23.0.0]
### Added
- Add method to check and update collectible ownership state ([#664](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/664))
- Add method to set a collectible as favorite ([#623](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/623))
- Update GasFeeController to use `eth_feeHistory` to compute gas fee recommendations when MetaSwap API is down ([#614](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/614))
- Update GasFeeController to expose additional data sourced from the MetaSwap API in support of design updates to "edit gas fee" functionality in extension ([#632](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/632)), ([#646](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/646), [#660](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/660))

### Changed
- **Breaking** Add caller-specified error for ApprovalController.clear ([#656](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/656))
  - The new caller-specified error is mandatory. Consumers must add this error when calling the clear method for method to function properly. 

### Fixed
- Fix polling initialization for collectibles ([#662](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/662))

## [22.0.0]
### Added
- **BREAKING**: Change IPFS URL generation to use subdomains and cidV1s over cidV0s, in order to enhance origin based security in our use of IPFS assets ([#655](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/655))
 - Consumers using an IPFS gateway(s) which does not support IPFS subdomain formats will need to set the new config value 'useIPFSSubdomains' on CollectiblesController to false in order to have continued IPFS resolution support.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: remove chainid normalization ([#651](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/651))
   - This is breaking for anyone who adapted consumption of CollectiblesController to make use of v21.0.0. The chainId in the collectibles state shape is no longer normalized to decimal. 

### Fixed
- Fix collectibles collection images ([#650](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/650))


## [21.0.1]
### Fixed
- Fix issue where chainId key in AllCollectibles & AllCollectibleContracts is formatted differently in manual collectible add and detection add flows. ([#648](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/648))

## [21.0.0]
### Added
- **BREAKING**: Add openSeaEnabled preference ([#645](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/645))
 - Consumers of the collectibleDetectionController and collectibleController who wish to continue use of OpenSea's API and AutoDetection will either need to configure openSeaEnabled to true after instantiating the controller now or expose a toggle for users to change the openSeaEnabled state in the preferences controller.

### Changed
- Change expected shape of OpenSea contract API to use collections ([#628](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/628))
- Modify requirements for adding OpenSea detected contract ([#644](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/644))

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Add detection params (userAddress, chainId) and remove duplicate source of truth ([#636](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/636))
 - Both collectibles and collectibleContracts are removed from CollectiblesController state.
  - Consumers who use these pieces of state will need to migrate to use the AllCollectibles and AllCollectiblesContracts state instead.

## [20.1.0]
### Added
- Add new method `addCollectibleVerifyOwnership` to CollectiblesController ([#635](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/635))
- Add setting in PreferencesController to enable/disable collectible autoDetection and check against it in CollectibleDetectionController ([#638](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/638))

### Changed
- Use user preferred ipfs gateway, as set in PreferencesController, to resolve ipfs based assets in CollectiblesController ([#637](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/637))

## [20.0.0]
### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove polling start call in detection controllers' constructors ([#629](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/629))
  - Consumers of either of the TokenDetection and CollectibleDetection controllers who wish to immediately start polling upon instantiation will need to call the start method on the controller immediately after instantiation.
- Remove ApprovalController.has signature overloads ([#624](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/624))

## [19.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Split AssetsDetectionController into CollectiblesDetectionController and TokenDetectionController ([#619](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/619))
  - Consumers of the AssetsDetectionController will have to now import both TokenDetectionController and CollectibleDetectionController and split up the calling of any methods accordingly.
- **BREAKING**: Set the `CurrencyRateController` property `conversionDate` to `null` if fetching the data fails. ([#621](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/621))
  - Consumers of the `CurrencyRateController` will need to ensure their code anticipates that `conversionDate` will sometimes be set to `null`.

## [18.0.0]
### Added
- **BREAKING**: ERC1155 support ([#615](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/615))
  -  `CollectiblesController` requires `getOwnerOf`, `balanceOfERC1155Collectible` and `uriERC1155Collectible` properties in the constructor which are methods from `AssetsContractController`.
- Add support for custom networks by querying the blockchain as default and add support for IPFS metadata URIs ([#616](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/616))

### Changed
- Bump @metamask/contract-metadata from 1.29.0 to 1.30.0 ([#607](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/607))

## [17.0.0]
### Added
- Add client id header to GasFeeController ([#597](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/597))

### Changed
- Improve transaction state management for custom networks ([#598](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/598))
- Make TokenRatesController support fiat conversion for more networks ([#585](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/585))

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Simplify type of BaseControllerV2 state ([#496](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/496))
  - Controllers based upon BaseControllerV2 might need to update their types.
  - Custom interfaces/classes will no longer be allowed in the controller state. Simple objects only.

## [16.0.0]
### Changed
- Enable HTTP caching for the dynamic token list managed by the TokenListController ([#594](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/594))

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove `syncTokens` method from the TokenListController ([#590](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/590))

### Fixed
- Fix bug that allowed `getGasFeeEstimatesAndStartPolling` to initiate multiple simultaneous fetch requests ([#586](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/586))
- Fix bug that cause an invalid tokenList to be in controller state when active network is not supported by our tokenList API ([#588](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/588))

## [15.1.0]
### Changed
- Improve transaction state management ([#582](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/582))
  - TransactionController improvement to reconcile the data between local and remote sources (Etherscan) and avoid misleading display of gas and/or status information.
- Bump immer from 8.0.1 to 9.0.6 ([#581](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/581))

## [15.0.2]
### Fixed
- Change AbortController to default import ([#579](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/579))
  - Fix error thrown when polyfilled AbortController is instantiated as a named import.

## [15.0.1]
### Fixed
- Add AbortController polyfill ([#575](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/575))
  - [15.0.0](#1500) introduced the use of the global AbortController to this package. The global AbortController was first introduced in Node 15, so this unintentionally broke support for the minimum Node version this package should support, which is Node 12. By polyfilling the AbortController, we restore Node 12 support.

## [15.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Update TokensController allTokens state structure to make network/chainID parent of account ([#572](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/572))
  - The shape of allTokens state field on TokensController has been reorganized. Consumers of the TokensController will have to migrate existing token state to new shape.
- **BREAKING:** ignoredTokens changed to allIgnoredTokens ([#570](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/570))
  - a new state field on the TokensController - allIgnoredTokens - now manages ignoredTokens by network and accountAddress, ignoredTokens is now the array of token address strings (previously an array of full token objects) that have been hidden by the user for the currently active network and accountAddress pair. Consumers of the TokensController will have to migrate existing ignoredTokens array to allIgnoredTokens object.
- **BREAKING:** Improve BaseControllerV2 messenger type ([#556](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/556))
  - This is a breaking change, because anyone extending BaseControllerV2 will now be required to supply an additional generic parameter.
- **BREAKING:** Remove redundant default export from util.ts ([#574](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/574))  
  - This is breaking for consumers who use the default import of the utils module, and will require using named imports instead.
- **BREAKING:** Removing aggregator from TokenListToken ([#564](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/564))
  - This is breaking because the the DynamicToken and TokenListToken types no longer contain an aggregators field. Consumers will have to remove aggregators for objects using this type.
- **BREAKING:** Migrate ApprovalController to BaseControllerV2 ([#555](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/555))
  - This is a breaking change because the BaseControllerV2 migration is breaking, and the 'resolve' method has been renamed to 'accept'.
- Speed up token detection for most popular 1000 tokens ([#568](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/568))
- Cancel inflight request during chainId change and useStaticTokenList flag change ([#571](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/571))
- Update the token list API host ([#563](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/563))
- Bump @metamask/contract-metadata from 1.28.0 to 1.29.0 ([#569](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/569))
- Reduce frequency of token list updates ([#561](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/561))
  - Previously it would update the token list upon _any_ preference or network configuration change. Now it only restarts polling when the network switches or when the `useStaticTokenList` flag changes. 

## [14.2.0]
### Added
- Added the ability to limit the number of transactions stored (default is 40) ([#550](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/550))

### Added
- **BREAKING** Add EIP1559 support including `speedUpTransaction` and `stopTransaction` ([#521](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/521))
